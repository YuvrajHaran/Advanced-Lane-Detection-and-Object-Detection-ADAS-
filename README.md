# Advanced-Lane-Detection-and-Object-Detection-ADAS-
Lane Detection + Object Detection

This project combines Lane Detection and Object Detection to build a simplified perception pipeline for autonomous driving. The goal is to detect lane lines on the road and identify surrounding vehicles, ensuring safer navigation for self-driving systems.

ðŸ”¹ Motivation

Autonomous vehicle safety heavily relies on accurate perception. While deep learning models like YOLO exist, this project focuses on developing the pipeline from scratch using computer vision and classical ML techniques to strengthen algorithmic understanding.

ðŸ”¹ Features
ðŸ›£ Lane Detection

Camera calibration & distortion correction

Binary thresholding with Sobel & color transforms

Perspective transform to birdâ€™s-eye view

Polynomial fitting for lane boundaries

Lane curvature & vehicle position estimation

ðŸš˜ Object Detection

HOG feature extraction

SVM classifier (Car vs Non-Car)

Sliding window search + HOG subsampling

Heatmaps & thresholding to remove false positives

Bounding box visualization

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Algorithms: Sobel Filters, Perspective Transform, Polynomial Fitting, HOG + SVM
